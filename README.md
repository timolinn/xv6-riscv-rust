# XV6 Rust

This is a port of the [XV6 operating system](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) to the Rust programming language.

The goal of this project is to provide a safe and modern implementation of the XV6 operating system, while keeping the original design and structure of the original implementation. It is also a learning project for me to get more familiar with the Rust programming language and operating system development.
